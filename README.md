## Coffee AR Showcase Experience

This repo provides Unity source files for an AR experience showcasing the House Of Coffees brand. The application is an Android AR application where a user is prompted to place a 3D model of artifacts related to the coffee brand. This project formed the technical assessment for CSIR to demonstrate my coding abilities.
